# Zipcode Choropleth with Plotly, Pandas and Mapbox
In this tutorial, we will be creating a choropleth of San Diego's Zipcodes based on Zillow's Price-to-Rent Ratio.
#### Mapbox Access Token
To plot on Mapbox maps with Plotly you'll need a Mapbox account and a [Mapbox Access Token](https://www.mapbox.com/studio) which you can add to your [Plotly settings](https://plot.ly/settings/mapbox). If you're using a Chart Studio Enterprise server, please see additional instructions here: https://help.plot.ly/mapbox-atlas/.
